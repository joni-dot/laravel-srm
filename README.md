# SRM – Supplier Relationship Management

A web app for procurement teams to manage supplier information. It works as a single-page app: pages change without full reloads.

| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Backend                 | Laravel 13 (PHP 8.5)               |
| Frontend                | Vue 3 + TypeScript, via Inertia.js |
| Styling                 | Tailwind CSS                       |
| Database                | PostgreSQL 18                      |
| Cache, sessions, queues | Redis                              |
| Local setup             | Docker (Laravel Sail)              |

## Getting started

You only need **Docker** and **git**. Everything else runs inside containers.

```bash
cp .env.example .env                 # then set DB_PASSWORD to a long random value
docker run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD":/app -w /app composer:latest composer install
./vendor/bin/sail build              # build the app image (first time only)
./vendor/bin/sail up -d              # start the app, database, Redis, Mailpit and the queue worker
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
./vendor/bin/sail pnpm install
./vendor/bin/sail artisan app:create-user   # pick the Admin role; there is no public sign-up
./vendor/bin/sail pnpm run dev       # live-reloading frontend
```

Open http://localhost. Admins invite other people from the **Users** page.

Emails (invitations, password resets) are sent in the background by the `queue` container and show up in Mailpit at http://localhost:8025. After changing PHP code that runs in the background, restart the worker with `./vendor/bin/sail restart queue`.

## Roles

| Role   | Can do                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Admin  | Everything, plus invite and manage users |
| Buyer  | Add and edit suppliers                   |
| Viewer | Look only                                |

Admins can't change their own role or deactivate themselves, so there is always at least one admin. Users are deactivated, never deleted, so their history stays intact.

## Everyday commands

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test            # run all tests
./vendor/bin/sail composer lint           # fix PHP code style
./vendor/bin/sail php vendor/bin/phpstan analyse   # find PHP type errors
./vendor/bin/sail pnpm run check:fix      # fix frontend style and lint
./vendor/bin/sail pnpm run types:check    # find TypeScript errors
```

Tip: add `alias sail='./vendor/bin/sail'` to your shell config to type less.

## Ground rules

- **Security first.** Every change is reviewed for security and performance before it is merged.
- **Readable code.** Code should explain itself through clear names and small functions. Comments are for _why_, not _what_.
- **Tests.** New behaviour comes with tests.
